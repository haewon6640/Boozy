Boozy
======

Boozy is a cocktail generator and social platform where users will be able to find recipes based on what alcohol they have submitted on their virtual shelf, submit their own cocktail recipes, and post, comment on and review what they are currently drinking.

Background and Overview
-----------------------
We've all been there - hanging out at home on a Saturday night and looking to make a cocktail with what we have on hand in our kitchen.  But what can we actually make?  With Boozy, users will be able to add alcohol, mixers and syrups to a virtual "Shelf" and generate a list of cocktails they can make with what they have on hand.  If a user is missing ingredients, they will be shown grocery stores, liqour stores or specialty shops where they might be able to find those ingredients.  
Users will also be able to submit, share and update their own cocktail recipes, as well as post what they are drinking, and review, comment and share if they are drinking another user's recipe.
Goals:
* Create a database to store user data, including ingredients on hand (the "Shelf"), submitted cocktails, comments and numerical reviews.
* Construct a generator that queries the cocktails databse and returns a list of cocktails made with ingredients that a user has on their "Shelf"
* Incorporate the Google Maps API to show nearby stores where users may find missing ingredients
* Utilize the Google Maps API to show what other users are drinking in your city on a homepage feed
* Create a search function for cocktails and different types of alcohol

MVP
---
### 1. User authorization, new account creation and login, and guest/demo login
  * Sign up, sign in, log out
  * Users can use a demo login to try out the site
  * Only logged in users can post, comment, create
### 2. Recipe creation and updating
  * User submitted recipes with pictures to share with other users
  * CRUD
### 3. Reviews
  * Users can review other recipes with using a five-star rating system, with aggregate scores shown on the cocktail show page
  * Users can add comments to their reviews, offering additional feedback
  * Users can use a numerical rating system of the five flavors (salty, sweet, sour, umami, bitter) with aggregate scores shown on the cocktail show page
  * Users can post photos with their reviews
### 4. Shelf
  * Users can add and remove items (alcohol, mixers, syrups, other ingredients) to their "Shelf", with possible cocktails generated by the ingredients on their shelf
### 5. Search/Filter
  * Users can search and filter for recipes based on alcohol types and flavor profiles
### 6. Feed
  * Reviews and comments will be added to a running feed on each user's feed, showing reviews of their recipes as well as what other users are drinking in their city, utilizing the Google Maps API 
### 7. Map
  * The Google Maps API will be utilized to populate the feed with what other users are drinking in their city
  * The Google Maps API will be utilized to show stores where you may be able to find missing ingredients
  
Technologies
------------
The backend of Boozy will be created using MongoDB and Express.

The frontend of Boozy will be created with React and Node.js.

We will incorporate the Google Maps API to show nearby stores as well as populate a feed with what other users are drinking in your area.

Technical Challenges:
Populating the feed with what other users are drinking nearby while not revealing the exact location of those users.

Generating cocktails from the database while showing missing ingredients and utilizing Google Maps API to show possible stores.

Search and filter based on flavor profiles.
